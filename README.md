#######Kottans frontend course

Task 0 (get familiar with Git and Github)

I got to know to myself that exist program "Git" and resource like "GitHub".
Git allows developer feel more sure at his work. Also he cans to experiment and doesnt afraid to lose some important code.
Internet resourse Github allows work team to do their work more effective and structured. Always they can possible to restore information or back up to "commit" without problems. 
When i finished udacity coure "How to use Git and "GitHub" I learned knowledge for beginning at Git and "Git Hub":
*Git commands;
*Concept map "Git" and "GitHub"; 
*Staging area;
how to creates: clone, branch, repositories; 
*How to coomit;
*How to collaborate;
*How to fork.
All stuff that i learned was absolutle new for me.
